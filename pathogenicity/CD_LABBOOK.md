C.*difficile* S-layers' proteins were collected (table) from bibliography. partial proteins were eliminated only the complete ones were retained

Non-toxigenic C.*diificile* (NTCD) strains are not well studied and not sequenced yet. even the first sequenced NTCD strain was in 2012 which is CD37  deposited in GenBank under accession number [AHJJ00000000](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/AHJJ00000000) but the sequence is not available for the moment (PMID: [22461557](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22461557/)) . Camorilinga et al. are currently sequencing NTCD strains (PMID: [30774626](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30774626/))

the blastp performed on the swissprot data base did not show any significant hit for SlpA of both 630 and CD168 C.difficile strains therefore the blastp was performed on the non-redundant database, and the redundancy was removed with skip-redundant
