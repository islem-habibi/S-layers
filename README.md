# S-layers
This repository is for presenting data and results of S-layer proteins (SLPs) analysis. SLPs have been studied according to their properties/functions
## Radioresistance
This directory contains data about analysis of Radioresistance-related SLPs. 
here we have studied the SlpA of a radioresistant bacterium *D. radiodurans* and have compared it to a closely related SlpA of a radiosensitive bacterium *T. thermophilus*
### DR_labbook
Resumes the computational analysis pipline applied to the collected proteins (the SlpA of *D. radiodurans* as well as its simmilar proteins)
### radiation_data
This table contains all the available data extracted from bibliography of our proteins
### dom_search table
This table contains information about the detected domains by sequence homogy when querying the SlpA of *D. radiodurans*
### Fasta
This directory contains fasta files of the studied proteins
### Results
This directory represents all the results found through our analysis pipeline


## Pathogenicity
This directory contains data about analysis of pathogenicity-related SLPs, case of *C. difficile* SlpA. 
### CD_labbook
Resumes the computational analysis pipline applied to the collected SlpA of *C. difficile*
### Fasta
A directory for fasta files of SlpA from different strains of *C. difficile* 
### Results
This directory contains the pipeline analysis results of the SlpA of *C. difficile* from different strains
