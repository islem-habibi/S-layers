Explanation of files in seqid.bind_in_one.zip,
where seqid is a number assigned by RaptorX-Binding to the query sequence
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

0README         : This README file.

seqid.fasta     : The user input sequence in FASTA format.

seqid.domain    : Domain boundary and assignment for each residue. Segments marked by 0 are not modeled.

seqid.quality   : The quality of the predicted model for each domain.

seqid.pdb       : The predicted model for the whole sequence in PDB format.

seqid.png       : The image of the predicted model for the whole sequence in PNG format.

seqid.cameo     : The text file for the prediction for each residue. See http://beta.cameo3d.org/cameong_help/lb/ for the format of the .cameo file.

domX/              : The folder contains all results for the X-th domain where X is the domain number.
  pocketY/         : The subfolder contains all superimposed ligand structures in each predicted pocket where Y is the pocket number.
  PocketRank.rtf   : The predicted pockets and the corresponding binding residues for the X-th domain.


In this package, except the image file, all the other files can be opened by WordPad on Windows or vi on Linux.
