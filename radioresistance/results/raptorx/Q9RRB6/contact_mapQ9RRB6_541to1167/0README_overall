0README_overall       : This README file

seqid		      : the ID assigned by the server to the query sequence

seqid.fasta           : the user input sequence in FASTA format

seqid.a2m             : Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) in A2M format
seqid.a3m             : Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) in A3M format

seqid.gcnn	      : predicted contact matrix in text format

seqid.rr	      : a list of top predicted contacts in the CASP format

seqid.png             : an image file for the predicted contact matrix

models/               : The folder contains the predicted five 3D models.
  0README             : a README file

  seqid_model_X.pdb   : The predicted models in PDB format, where X ranges from 1 to 5.

  seqid.model_summary : The file contains the NOE violation in Angstrom of the predicted 3D models. Model error is proportional to NOE violation.


In this package, except the image file, all the other files are saved in plain text format.
