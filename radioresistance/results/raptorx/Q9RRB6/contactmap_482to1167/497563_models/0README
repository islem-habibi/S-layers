0README             : This README file.

seqid		    : The ID assigned by RaptorX-Contact Server to the query sequence

seqid_model_X.pdb   : The predicted five 3D models in PDB format, where X ranges from 1 to 5.

seqid.model_summary : The file contains the NOE violation in Angstrom of the predicted 3D models. Model error is proportional to the NOE violation.

In this package, all files can be opened by WordPad on Windows or vi on Linux.
